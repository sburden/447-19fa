Self-assessment\n","\n","The following questions are intended to help you and the instructors assess your background knowledge;  **you do not already need to know how to answer these questions, or answer the questions correctly, to receive credit on this assignment** -- if you are not familiar with what the question is asking, just say so.  If you need to consult textbooks, websites, or other resources to answer the question, note the resource.\n","\n","\n","a. Consider the mathematical statement $\\forall x,y\\in \\mathbb{R} : (x\\neq y) \\implies (\\exists z\\in\\mathbb{R} : (x < z < y) \\vee (y < z < x))$.\n","\n","a.1 Translate the mathematical statement into a complete English sentence, including proper capitalization and punctuation; **include no mathematical symbols in your English translation**.  \n","\n","a.2 Is this statement true or false?\n","\n","a.3 Can you prove (or provide a counterexample to substantiate) your answer to (a.2)?\n","\n","\n","b. Consider the polynomial expression $a x^2 + b x + c$.\n","\n","b.1 Regarding this as a polynomial in $x$, compute the roots.\n","\n","b.2 Regarding this as a polynomial in $a$, compute the roots.\n","\n","b.3 Are any extra assumptions required for your answers to (b.1) or (b.2) to make sense?\n","\n","\n","c.
